# Building

The game has a construction system that allows players to place different elements:

* Structures: These are parts of buildings, such as foundations, walls, posts and doorways. Buildings have several levels (shooting galleries), each with a large number of strength points. To break a building, you must use a tool of the appropriate level and dash.
* Objects: these are small objects that can only be placed on the foundation or roof. Objects usually have a limited amount of strength and often perform certain functions.

Creating(placing) and improving buildings takes time, which takes a certain number of game cycles. In addition, buildings can be instantly destroyed within a certain amount of time after installation.

Their strength can be restored by using appropriate resources. Over time, buildings are susceptible to rotting. To prevent rotting, it is necessary to have some facility that will expend resources to keep the "house" in good condition.

Some mechanisms and systems require bio-energy to operate. Bioenergy can be obtained from various generators or from other sources in the game world.\
All defensive structures require a power source for their operation.

The locking system has changed
{% endhint %}

Basic locks used on doors or chests require a key to open. One key can be used to open multiple locks. Any player who has the appropriate key in his inventory can open a lock.&#x20;

Simple locks that are used with keys can be picked by other players using special methods or tools.
