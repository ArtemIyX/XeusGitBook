# Alchemy and craft

## Alchemy

[Brain disruption](character-state.md#brain-disruption) is a negative state in the game. When reaching 0% braind disruption, the character gets into a very difficult state, which can lead to his death.

Brain disruption can be cured by normal waiting, but when killed en masse the game becomes difficult and requires special attention and effort on the part of the player. Anti-disruption is a cure that can temporarily delay the reduction of schizophrenia, but can have negative effects on the character in return.

A low level of braind disruption unlocks crafting recipes that are not available in the normal state. Creating these items requires resources that can only be obtained while in the low schizo state.

Basically, these crafting recipes are related to the creation of alchemical medicines that can help restore health and overcome the negative effects of the game world. This gives the player the ability to use unique and valuable resources while in a low braind disruption state to create effective medicines.

## Crafting

In the game, crafting is the process of creating items using recipes. Each recipe specifies which items are needed to create a particular item. Crafting requires a certain amount of time to complete.

When the player is away from the crafting station, he has limited options for crafting. Basically, only basic items can be produced, or simple actions that do not require complex tools can be performed. Handcrafting can be difficult and time-consuming.

Basic and more complex items can be created in a crafting station. In order to use a crafting station, the player must be in the vicinity of it. This may require building and maintaining an appropriate station in the game world.

Recipes for crafting can be obtained in various ways. Some recipes can be unlocked as you level up your character. Other recipes can be learned at special study tables that are available in the game world. Recipes can also be found in special events such as airdrops or other sources in the game world.

Recipes represent a key component for development and progression in the game. Players should strive to obtain new recipes in order to expand their ability to craft and create more complex items.
