# Equipment

## Inventory

The inventory in the game Xeus consists of slots provided by clothing and other equipment for storing items. Items can occupy NxM slots. The main slots are provided by backpacks, while other equipment (clothing) provides only 2-3 slots.

Inventory capacity is limited by weight. If the weight limit is exceeded, the character slows down, expends more energy, and is limited in movement (unable to squat, jump, or run).

The character has two "fast slots". One of the slots can only be occupied by a one-handed tool. Each item has a strength. If the strength of the equipment is low, items begin to fall out of the inventory, and some slots become inaccessible. If the strength of a tool is low, its efficiency decreases and the amount of energy expended increases. At 0% strength, the equipment cannot be dressed and the tool cannot be used.When an item is restored, its maximum strength is reduced to a certain limit.

Food has a spoilage index, which is expressed as a percentage. Food can be cleaned, but in this case it will lose its caloric value. Consumption of spoiled or raw food has a negative effect on the character's health.

## Character level, experience

{% hint style="warning" %}
The mechanics are not fully thought out and half of what is described most likely will not be implemented

~~When creating a character at the beginning of the game, the player is given the opportunity to choose a class. Each class has its own unique buffs, debuffs and activity preferences.~~

Almost all actions performed by a character bring a small amount of experience. However, when a character is reborn, half of the experience gained is lost, including learned passive and active skills.

A character gains more experience for engaging in his/her favorite activity, increases his/her reputation, and relieves mental tension.

Increasing a character's level gives a unit of passive skill, which remains constant. To upgrade a passive skill requires a certain character level and several units of passive skill (usually 1 to 3).

At certain character levels, a choice between two more useful skills or perks is always offered. The player can choose one of these for character development.

{% hint style="info" %}
The linear character progression system has been replaced by a tree(branching) system
{% endhint %}

Leveling up also unlocks new recipes for crafting items. Recipes do not disappear after learning and remain available to the character. However, a certain level of crafting skill may be required to create complex and powerful items.

## Tools leveling-up

Regardless of who uses the tool, the item can be pumped. As the level of the item increases, its characteristics also increase.

For weapons, the game provides pumping in the PVP and PVE sections. PVP characteristics are pumped more actively when killing other players, while PVE characteristics are pumped when killing monsters or completing tasks in the game world.

PVP characteristics of weapons do not directly influence the time to kill (Time To Kill), they rather increase the convenience of weapon use. For example, such characteristics as or shooting stability can be improved, which makes the weapon more comfortable for the player while fighting.

It is important to note that the maximum level of some tools is limited. This means that items reach their maximum development potential and can no longer be pumped or improved after reaching a certain level.
