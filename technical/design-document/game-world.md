# Game world

## Map

{% hint style="danger" %}
The game world system has been replaced by a fully procedurally generated map, and the players' limit is 64
{% endhint %}

The game contains a static map with a small size, which is not procedurally generated. The map contains various objects, such as ruins, which are static and cannot be destroyed.

Each pair of objects on the map contains a unique object, such as a workbench or resource source. Each object has its own uniqueness and functionality, offering players different options and benefits. For example, a workbench can be used to create and improve items, and a resource source can provide necessary materials for game progress.

Each object on the map is sure to contain a protected oxygen station or oxygen source. This is important for maintaining the character's oxygen supply and his survival in the game. The oxygen source can be used to replenish the oxygen supply, and the protected oxygen station can provide a safe place for the character to recover his supplies.

The map is not initially available to view, but players have the option to create one. This means that players must explore and master the game world in order to create the map and gain insight into its structure and content.

Given the small size of the map, there should be enough space for 24 players to move freely and interact with each other without feeling cramped or overwhelmed.

## Moving around the world

Due to extra-atmospheric conditions such as different pressure, temperature and gravity from Earth, character movement has a high degree of fluidity, making [strafing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strafing\_\(video\_games\)) almost impossible.

When falling, the character takes significantly more damage, making it lethal to the character. The character shows no inclination to jump to greater heights, probably due to the special environmental conditions.

Making the jump requires significant stamina consumption, possibly related to the character's adaptation to the unusual environmental conditions. Consequences of the jump include an almost total loss of control of the character, possibly as a result of the forces inherent in the action.

Performing a squat takes a significant amount of time and during this process the character loses control of his or her movements.

Using the sprint results in a rapid depletion of stamina, but allows you to create distance between the character and the pursuing creature. Running away from the other player is very difficult due to these features. During the sprint the character loses its maneuverability, possibly due to the effects of the physical forces affecting movement in this game universe.

## Resources

Resources cannot be extracted from the air in the game, but they are virtually infinite. There is an important resource in the world, similar to wood, which does not regenerate itself. At the beginning of the game this resource is present throughout the map, but after its extraction you need to grow a new specimen.

There are objects on the map where you can get the "seeds" of this resource. The player is given the opportunity to collect these "seeds" and use them to plant new plants of this resource.

Most of the resources in the game can be obtained by extracting them from mobs, that is, various creatures found in the game world. The player has the ability to attack these mobs and obtain the necessary resources from their bodies (inventory). This can include various items, materials or raw materials that can be used to create new items, constructions.

## Seasons and hanging the time of day

There are seasons in the game, and their duration is measured in days, where each season lasts several days. The values of the length of day and night vary depending on the current season.

The events in the game depend on the current season. Each season has its own unique characteristics and events that occur. Some random events occur in each season, but with differences between them.

For example, rain in the game can happen in any season, but the type of rain depends on the current season and time of day. This means that different seasons and times of day can provide different types of rain, such as showers, drizzle, or thunderstorms.

Nighttime changes the conditions of the game. In random places, plants begin to grow out of the surface, which serve as mini oxygen sources. Some mobs also change their behavior at night. In addition, staying in complete darkness leads to the accelerated development of the player's Brain disruption effect.

Thus, the seasons in the game determine the length of day and night, as well as affect various events, including the type of rain and changing conditions of the game at night.

## Мобы

In the game, there are monsters that move only on the ground or remain stationary. There are a total of four types of mobs:&#x20;

1. Aggressive&#x20;
2. Neutral
3. Passive
4. Mixed

Only aggressive monsters attack other monsters. All other mobs behave passively in relation to other creatures. Passive mobs are divided into two types: Scary and non-shy.

Scary mobs always try to run away from other creatures, especially from the player. Non-scary mobs ignore a creature as long as it doesn't hurt them.

Neutral mobs do not attack a creature until it harms them. They remain neutral and are not aggressive until summoned for combat.

Aggressive mobs will attack surrounding creatures under certain conditions, adhering to a specific targeting priority. They can attack the player as well as other mobs.

Mixed mobs usually combine two types of behavior. One type manifests itself during the day and the other at night. For example, they can be neutral during the day and become aggressive at night and vice versa.

Aggressive mobs will also seek to destroy the player's buildings, if they belong to the player. Mobs can exist in packs, i.e. groups where they move and act together.

Each mob in the game usually has a pseudo-random set of parameters for each server. These parameters determine what type of damage the mob does (more or less damage) and what minimum tool power is needed to carve its carcass or get resources.

## Airdrop

Cargo from the Air is a random event in the game. This event can occur unpredictably and contains various resource sets that are important to any player.

In some cases, a cargo from the air may contain unique materials that have been brought in from other satellites or planets. These materials are an improved version of existing resources available in the game world.

However, airdrops are not just a box you can walk up to and get loot. Various dangers or events can occur around the airdrop that give them more storytelling and provide additional challenges for players. Some examples of such plots might include:

* Attracting Predators: Falling cargo from the air can attract the attention of predators who gather around to try to gain access to the contents. Players will have to deal with this threat to gain access to resources.
* Opposing faction drones: When a shipment drops, opposing faction drones may try to intercept or destroy the contents to prevent them from falling into players' hands. Players must fight these drones to protect and gain access to the cargo.
* Unfortunate Drop: On rare occasions, a cargo from the air may experience an unfortunate drop, causing electrical failures or other dangerous events around it. This can limit player access to the contents and create additional challenges to resolve.

Такие "_сюжетные"_ элементы вокруг аирдропов делают их более интересными и захватывающими, требуя от игроков принятия решений и участия в дополнительных сражениях или испытаниях, чтобы получить желаемые ресурсы.
