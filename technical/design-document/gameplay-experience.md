# Gameplay experience

## Developer's thoughts

The goal of this game is to create a unique experience that combines elements of exoplanet combat simulation and survival in the uncharted wilderness. The resulting combination provides a balanced balance between PVE and PVP gameplay modes, providing players with a variety of interaction options.

What sets this game apart is that PVE and PVP are interdependent and do not replace each other. Unlike games like Rust, Unturned and DayZ, where PVP has a predominant role, or ARK: Survival Evolved, The Forest and 7 Days to Die, where PVE is the main one, this game provides a harmonious interaction of both modes.

The PVE system gives players the opportunity to explore an unearthly environment, fight hostile creatures, and evolve in an unconventional environment. This includes surviving, gathering resources, building shelters, and exploring the environment.

On the other hand, the PVP system allows players to fight each other in duels and competitions, form alliances or engage in conflicts with other players. This provides unique opportunities for tactical play, team building and strategic planning.

The combination of PVE and PVP in this game creates a dynamic and exciting environment where players can choose their playing style and enjoy different aspects of gameplay. As a result, players get the maximum variety of options and experiences that combine the advantages of both modes, making the game unique and appealing to a wide audience.

## Player interactions

Due to the limited size of the game map and the high density of resources, players will often clash with each other. A similar situation is seen in other games, but unlike them, this game will use a reputation system, which aims to correct such experiences. Under this system, the more kills the player commits, the more difficulties he will encounter in the game.

Before another murder, the player will think about the consequences of his action. Undoubtedly, this complicates the gameplay for clans, which tend to constantly destroy other players, because they, in turn, are also at risk of being destroyed. However, it is thanks to the reputation system that it will be possible to play alone as well as in a group.

## Player vs Player

An important aspect of the game is the PVP component, but the main problem inherent in most PVP survival games is the endless fighting for territory devoid of meaning or content.

To create an enjoyable gaming experience for all players, there is no way to just kill other players in this game. Almost all weapons have a medium range, which limits their effectiveness. Firearms are considered a luxury because, while they can kill quickly, they require additional resources such as oxygen, ammo, and tools to repair. In addition, firing firearms has the unpleasant characteristics of high pressure, low temperature, and a dense atmosphere that make bullets travel slower.

It is important to note that any weapon can instantly kill an opponent if the shot hits the head. This creates an equal opportunity to win based on the player's skill, rather than simply based on the type of weapon in his hands. In this case, two headshots means two dead opponents, which emphasizes the importance of player skill in gameplay.

## Player vs Entity

Mobs in the game are not only simple models that chase the player and can be killed. They also pose a significant threat, attack actively and require the player to be strategic. Raiding other players is worth planning just as carefully as the next mob hunt. Gameplay challenges the player not only to pay attention to other players, but also to ordinary mobs.

It is important to understand that mobs have their own characteristics and abilities. They may have different attacks, vulnerabilities, tactics and difficulty levels. Some mobs may be more aggressive and dangerous than others. The player needs to consider these factors when planning his actions and choosing his fighting strategy.

In this way, gameplay encourages the player to think not only about other players, but also about the presence and behavior of the animals. This adds depth and complexity to the game world, requiring the player to be able to make decisions, plan his actions, and interact effectively with different types of threats.

## Building in different games

The building systems in Unturned and Rust are similar and almost perfect. However, Unturned lacks gravity and decay, while Rust lacks adequacy. Both games also have one flaw: the ability to build a structure within seconds.

Xeus has a more realistic approach to building, requiring considerable effort and time from the player to build a house. This has several advantages:

* Confidence in the safety of buildings: The player can be sure that his house will still be standing the next day, and in case of a failed raid, some resources will remain with him.
* Smaller bases: By taking longer to build in Xeus, the overall size of buildings is reduced, which helps reduce the problems associated with taking over clan territories and blocking access to castles.
* Eliminating raids for raids' sake: The long construction process in Xeus prevents random raids for no good reason. Players have to carefully plan their actions and choose the best moment to raid, thus enhancing the tactical aspect of gameplay.

Thus, the building system in Xeus requires more effort and time from the player, which brings several advantages, such as building preservation, smaller bases, and more focused raids.

## Inventory in different games

Xeus takes into account the limitations of weight, number of slots, and size of items to create a more realistic and balanced game experience. This allows players to carry only a certain number of items and have limited storage options.

Because Xeus focuses on survival rather than sorting through inventory, players don't have to spend a lot of time manipulating items as they do in games like Escape from Tarkov or Unturned. The number of item slots in Xeus is relatively small.

This creates a problem when killing another player, especially if his inventory is full of resources. In such cases, it is almost impossible to take away all of his resources because of the limited storage and transfer options. This encourages players to take these limitations into account and make decisions about which items to take with them and which to leave behind.

Thus, the weight, slot, and size limitations of items in Xeus make killing another player more problematic and require players to make strategic decisions about storing and carrying resources.
