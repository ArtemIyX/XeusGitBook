# ðŸ‘‹ Welcome to Xeus!

## ABOUT THIS GAME

Welcome to Xeus, a multiplayer survival game that takes you to an exoplanet full of dangers and challenges. In this game, you'll face a constant battle for survival against natural conditions, animals, plants, and other players.

But Xeus is more than just a survival game. It has unique mechanics such as state of mind, alchemy, and electricity that add depth and complexity to the gameplay. Use your state of mind to understand the world and discover hidden abilities. Master alchemy to turn raw materials into powerful potions and explosives. Use the power of electricity to illuminate your base, power machines and defend against attacks.

Whether you prefer PvP or PvE, Xeus has something for you. You can level up your character depending on the situation, adapting to the challenges ahead. With an emphasis on realism, every move you make could be your last, and every decision you make will have consequences.

To survive, you will have to be resourceful and cunning. Build houses to protect yourself and conserve your resources, or raid other players' houses to steal what you need. But beware: other players are just as desperate as you are, and they won't hesitate to attack if they see an opportunity.

Are you ready to take on the Xeus challenge? Join the community and begin your journey around the exoplanet today!
